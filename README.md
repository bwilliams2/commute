# TCMapper

Project to create visualization tools for Twin Cities metro and Greater Minnesota. 

Current visualizations:
    1. Area property parcel analysis to visualize new addresses in given     radius of selected location.
    2. Election analysis for 2012 - 2020 elections in Great Minnesota with per precinct visualizations
    3. Model for change in DFL-GOP margin in the Twin Cities metro based on precinct-specific housing properties and statistics including property value, distance from city center, and growth rates.

Project is Django/Vue based with visualizations created in Leaflet and D3.js.
